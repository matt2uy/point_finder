Roadmap:

11/26/17
- Attempt to compare scoreboard data with historical instances (at t-1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- if that works -> spit out point timestamps -> clean up noisy timestamps -> edit.

12/5/17 
- Test with a full challenger match

12/19/17
- Try smooth ball tracking
- if that works -> test on non-challenger matches

12/26/17 
- regardless of smooth ball tracking -> try it out.


How to determine when a point is finished:

1. Use the "amount of motion"
- before serve: the least?
- point ends: 'deceleration'?

2. net cord?
- but players will interfere? 
- model the tennis court?

3. Sound
- interference?
- faster?
- define a tennis ball bounce/racket sound

4. Ball tracking
- check for 'smooth path'
- if there is no smooth path for more than 2 seconds, 
... then the point is finished?

	- opencv houghcircles python
	- kalman filter to predict movement
	- trace path?
	- how to judge if a path is 'smooth'?
