Roadmap:

11/26/17
- Attempt to compare scoreboard data with historical instances (at t-1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- if that works -> spit out point timestamps -> clean up noisy timestamps -> edit.

12/5/17 
- Test with a full challenger match

12/19/17
- Try smooth ball tracking
- if that works -> test on non-challenger matches

12/26/17 
- regardless of smooth ball tracking -> try it out.

12/29/17
- check this: https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/14802/can-i-use-ffmpeg-in-a-commercial-product
- some more docs: https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html
- video editor...
	- automatic cropping (using the tennis court lines)
	- "easy" editing (cuts, remove clips, etc...)
- then make it an online video editor?

A few "point finding" methods.
How to determine when a point is finished:

1. Use the "amount of motion"
- before serve: the least?
- point ends: 'deceleration'?

2. net cord?
- but players will interfere? 
- model the tennis court?

3. Sound
- Does not work with the presence of a "crowd", because the "clapping" interfered with the sound of the ball-racquet interactions.

4. Ball tracking
- check for 'smooth path'
- if there is no smooth path for more than 2 seconds, 
... then the point is finished?

	- opencv houghcircles python
	- kalman filter to predict movement
	- trace path?
	- how to judge if a path is 'smooth'?
